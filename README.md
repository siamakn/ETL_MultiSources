# Multi-Source ETL Job with Three Data Formats

This repository contains an example ETL job designed to extract, transform, and load data from nine different sources in three distinct formats: CSV, JSON, and XML. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of handling multiple data sources and formats within a single ETL process.
